This notebook was originally developed on a local system.  
Therefore, file paths are defined using a local base path:

```python
base_path = r"C:\Users\Vishal\Desktop\Hackthon"
To run this notebook successfully:

🔧 Update Path Before Running
Change the base path according to your system, for example:

base_path = r"./data"
OR

base_path = r"/path/to/your/data/folder"
▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository

Place datasets inside the /data folder

Update base_path in the notebook

Run all cells

📊 Output
A final merged dataset was created and analyzed to answer all business-driven questions provided in the hackathon.
